Click bubbles for double points, beat the timer to win!

# Description-
"The Bubble Game is an engaging web-based game where players can click on bubbles to earn points. Each time the page is rendered, a new bubble appears. When a player clicks on a bubble, they earn double the usual 10 points, and the bubble is automatically replaced with a new one. The game continues until the timer reaches zero, at which point the game is over."
